<h1>Boy Scout Merit Badge Day</h1>
<h3>Programming 2 Exercises</h3>

Alloted time: 30 minutes

<h3>How to use</h3>
Exercises are listed in Blink.ino. Comment and uncomment exercises with Ctrl-C and compile. Scouts will complete as much as they can. 

<h3>Teaching</h3> 
DO NOT TYPE CODE FOR SCOUTS. Let the scouts do all typing. They learn by 
doing. Have the "List of Arduino functions.pdf" on the other side 
of the screen and ask them which function matches. Again, DO NOT TYPE CODE
for scouts. 

<h3>Use with the following circuit</h3>
- Common-anode RGB LED (only the R and G are necessary)
- Photoresistor/button
MAKE SURE the green LED has twice the resistance as red and blue. 
This allows for a nice "yellow" color. 

Connect RGB cathodes to pins listed below. Connect photoresistor
like this: 5V--photoresistor--10k--GND and connect A0 between 
photoresistor and GND.
